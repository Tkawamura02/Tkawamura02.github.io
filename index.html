                When I was younger, I would sneak into my parents room to 
                look at their bookshelves. They always seemed like towering 
                buildings that were ready to topple any second and when I 
                found anything of interest I would use chairs to reach the 
                higher shelves. On this rather peculiar day 
                I snooped around my father's desk, which was always 
                meticulously clean as he was cleaning freak. There was one thing 
                that stood out to my childish eyes: a bookmark on the floor. 
                "What does it say?" I thought to myself while reaching 
                for it. There was nothing special about it. In fact, 
                it was rather plain. "Never, ever ever ever ever give up" it read.
                "Well that's odd" I said outloud.

                    Dear reader,
                </p>
                <p class="about-me-letter">
                    You must be wondering why I wrote about this particular event. 
                    I have my reasons which I will write to you henceforth. I 
                    continued about my childish hobbies without a worry on my mind. 
                    But as I grew older, it stuck with me. It forever changed the 
                    way I approached problems and thought about conflicts.
                </p>
                <p class="about-me-letter">
                    Yours faithfully,
                </p>

                I was never one to meddle with other people's business 
                but I later brought it up with my father fifteen years 
                later. I questioned him and asked why he even kept an 
                old bookmark like that. He told me that that was his 
                favorite quote when he was younger.
